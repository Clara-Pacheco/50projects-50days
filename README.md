# 💻 50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript
<br>

This repository includes 50 mini projects in HTML, CSS & JavaScript that relate to the DOM (Document Object Model) to sharpen those skills by building 50 quick, unique & fun mini projects. Here is a list of what is create in this course:

## 1️⃣ Expanding Cards

![preview](https://github.com/Clara-Pacheco/50projects-50days/blob/main/day1_expandingCards/video/project1_preview.gif)

So in this project, I built some expanding cards.

Basically, I styled these panels to have a background image and a heading, use Flexbox to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when we click one of these, it changes the class to active and it then expands with a CSS transition.

JavaScript is used for the event.

Listeners will be using CSS transitions to give it the smooth through the effect.

You'll see the heading doesn't come in until the card is fully expanded as well and I´m using just background images and headings, but you could make these into testimonials or FAQs or whatever it might be useful.

## 2️⃣ Progress Steps

In this project, I´m going to build some progress steps and you might see these in different kinds of websites with forms multi basically like multi level forms, shopping carts, things like that.

Just a progress bar that starts at one and just goes along.

It´s not going to have any form or anything, but we'll have these buttons to control the steps.

So it starts at one.

He's got this blue outline.

If I click next, then it goes to two.

The line we get transition goes over to two to border lights up, click next again and the same happens to threee and so on.

If we are at the beginning, previous is disabled, if we're at the end, then next is disabled. Like that we can just go back and forth.

So we'll start off with the HTML style, style it with CSS and then we'll add the functionality with JavaScript.

## 3️⃣ Rotating Navigation Animation

Tn this project, we basically just have a simple article.

This could be anything at all, any website, any blog, whatever.

And up here we have the little navigation icon.

If we click this icon, what's going to happen is it actually rotates the entire website, and then it brings in the NAV menu, the navigation items from the side and the icon also changes from open to close button.

We're going to position them so that when we click it, this circle rotates and shows the close button.

Obviously we need a little bit of JavaScript to be able to add and remove the specific class, which I am going to call show NAV and that will rotate and bring the menu in.

So it's it's going to be mostly CSS that we're dealing with.

We need to add specific styles for specific elements.

When the show NAV class is present, the only JavaScript we really need is to add or move the class when we click this button.

## 4️⃣ Hidden Search Widget

This is going to be one of the shortest projects, but it's a cool little widget that you can add to your website or to your application.

It's a hidden search, and we just have this button here with a little search icon from font awesome.

And as soon as we click it, it fires off a JavaScript event that activates a specific class where we add a transition for the width of this input to get wider and the button to move over using a transform property 'Translate X'. If we click it again, it's going to shrink back up.

So we'll be using CSS transitions along with just a little bit of JavaScript to add the event and toggle the class.

Many people jump into a frontend framework too early. Learning vanilla JavaScript and understanding how the document object model works are essential before moving to a framework. Practicing by coding those projects teaches you this by creating real-world projects of all types.

You will also learn more about HTML5 and CSS including semantic tags in your markup, basic CSS properties such as colors, alignment, flexbox, and shadows as well as creating responsive layouts with CSS media queries, CSS custom properties, animations/transitions, and more.

50 projects may seem like a lot, but they are small enough and it is possible to complete a project in just a few hours. Of course, this depends on your skill level.
